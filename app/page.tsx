          Vintage Reptiles is based in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada.

          <br /><br />I am a small scale breeder focusing on crested geckos, gargoyle geckos and tropical plants. I currently only offer shipping across Canada.

          <br /><br />Iâ€™ve been a part of the reptile hobby for 10 years and have been breeding for 4 of those years!

          <br /><br />All inquiries will go through my Instagram page <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vintage_reptiles/" className="text-[#cb18db]">@vintage_reptiles</a> as I like to talk to the people who are interested in buying my geckos and plants.

          <br /><br />Please read my Terms of Service before making a purchase! My DMs are always open to questions and inquiries.
